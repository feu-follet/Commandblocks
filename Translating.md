#Translations
If you like the mod and you would like to play it in your native language, you can translate it by creating a new bundle (refer to mindustry bundles for the local tag of your country). You can also fix translation errors if you see some by editing existing bundles.

#Bundle-lib
The mod uses the bundle-lib script, which allows you to change mod name and description in terms of language. You can do it by adding "mod.commandblocks.name" and "mod.commandblocks.description" to your bundle.

Thank you !
